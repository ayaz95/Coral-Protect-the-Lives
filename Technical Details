Technical Details 

Back-end API development
- Using Flask as a framework as an API interface to the coordinate data displayed on the map.
- Use a lightweight development base on the back end and add features as needed
- The back-end API is connected to a Mysql database and has a certain error tolerance.
- The back-end developed a cache mechanism, because the query coordinates of the data requires algorithmic computing time, so the cache can greatly reduce the length of time the user waits for data display

Coordinate processing back-end development
- The camera locations are not around the river, so to simulate a polluted river and make the project more meaningful, all camera locations are automatically assigned by the algorithm to a specific river location.
- The calculation is done using a matching search algorithm based on the morhattan distance.
- The use of cache mechanism greatly reduces user waiting time

Front-end Dashboard Development
- The front-end theme framework using Wordpress for secondary development
- Use responsive pages on the front end and integrate modules such as data display, map display, video display, project monitoring, etc.

Convolution Neural Network
- Used pytorch for CNN and pretrained the data using ResNet architecture.

Forecasting
- Used ARIMA Time Series model for Forecasting.

Tableau - Tableau Dashboard is used for creating the correlation visualization between City of Melbourne suburbs and events conducted in the suburbs.
